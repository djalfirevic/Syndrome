Regarding the switching from locally storing data to a REST API, I would do the following:

1) DataManager class would we an abstract class, and it would have a two subclasses: DatabaseDataManager and RESTDataManager.
2) DatabaseDataManager would have implementation as is.
3) RESTDataManager would provide their own implementation, for example:

Saving:

- (Patient *)savePatientWithName:(NSString *)name
surname:(NSString *)surname
gender:(NSInteger)gender
age:(NSInteger)age
migraines:(BOOL)migraines
drugsUse:(NSInteger)drugsUse;

In method implementation instead of using NSEntityDescription, I would use NSURLSession, and I would call some REST web service where I would send those parameters via POST and after the server response, I would have the instance of object.

Updating:

Basically the same as saving.

Fetching:

Instead of getting data from database, some REST web service will provide me a JSON response with all the patients, and after parsing, I would have all the data.
